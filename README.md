# FEND-Build-A-Portfolio
Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Project 1: Build a Portfolio Site
For this project, I'll be building a portfolio website.

### Project Overwiew
 I was provided a design mockup as a PDF-file, and must replicate that design in HTML and CSS which I can further tweak to make customizations to the design to personalize it and make it my own. I develop a responsive website that display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects I will complete through the course of my Nanodegree program.

 ### Why This Project
The first thing potential employers look for isn’t which school you attended or what your GPA was; they want to see what you’ve built! You need a professional portfolio to show off your skills.

In this project I built a great looking portfolio where I can show off images, descriptions, links and modals to all of my projects. I did whiles writing code that conforms to the Udacity Style Guide http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/ .
